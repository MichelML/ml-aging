The goal of the competition is to detect siRNA variation through technical noise caused by batch effets.

Even when experiments are designed to control for technical variables such as temperature, humidity, and reagent concentration, batch effects unavoidably enter into the data, resulting in images that contain factors of variation due to either biologically relevant variables or irrelevant technical variables.

Batch effects threaten to confound any set of experiments across the entire field of biology. Machine disentanglement of batch effects from relevant biological variables would be applicable across the field and could have broad impacts on accelerating drug discovery and development.

THE BIOLOGY
The 6-channel fluorescent microscopy images that comprise the RxRx1 dataset illuminate different organelles of the cell - the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, actin cytoskeleton, nucleolus, mitochondria, and golgi apparatus.
The experiment uses a modified Cell Painting staining protocol (CellPainting, a high-content image-based assay for morphological profiling using multiplexed fluorescent dyes, Bray et. al., 2016) which uses 6 different stains to adhere to different parts of the cell. The stains fluoresce at different wavelengths and are therefore captured by different imaging channels; thus there are 6 images per imaging site in a well. Each image captures different morphology of the same segment of the well, like layers of a 3 dimensional structure

The images in RxRx1 are generated by carrying out biological experiments using reagents known as siRNAs. A small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a biological reagent used to knockdown a particular gene, and every genetic perturbation used in the RxRx1 dataset is carried out via an siRNA. To understand these biological reagents, itâ€™s important to review some key biological concepts.




***On the visualization notebook (https://colab.research.google.com/github/recursionpharma/rxrx1-utils/blob/master/notebooks/visualization.ipynb):

This has all the elements needed to convert 6 channels images to combined RGB image. Look at this for utils for data processing. Namely the load method.


***On the training ResNet50 notebook (https://colab.research.google.com/github/recursionpharma/rxrx1-utils/blob/master/notebooks/training.ipynb): 

The other notebooks may not be necessary as we may not use TPU from google cloud.
