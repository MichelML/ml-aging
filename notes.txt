***On the visualization notebook (https://colab.research.google.com/github/recursionpharma/rxrx1-utils/blob/master/notebooks/visualization.ipynb):

This has all the elements needed to convert 6 channels images to combined RGB image. Look at this for utils for data processing. Namely the load method.


***On the training ResNet50 notebook (https://colab.research.google.com/github/recursionpharma/rxrx1-utils/blob/master/notebooks/training.ipynb): 

The other notebooks may not be necessary as we may not use TPU from google cloud.
